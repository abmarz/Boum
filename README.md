*We put a lot of thought into this logo's design. Allow us to break it down. The left sail represents our ancestors, whose legacy propels us forward. The right sail symbolizes our future, shaped by their influence. The left sail is smaller and incomplete, reflecting the uncertainty of the past. In contrast, the right sail is a larger and full version of the left, representing the promise and potential of our future.*

# About Boum

Three centuries ago amid the deserts of Arabia, a large group of families decided to leave the harsh living conditions they were in and head northward. At the end of their journey, what they assumed to be a mirage was in fact a glistening shore nestled atop the Arabian gulf, and in this shimmering coastline they saw a new beginning. 

This collection of families worked together to forge and foster a beautiful community, entrenched with a beautiful culture woven with the fabrics of faith, family, and tradition. On the other side of the shore was a whole new world (cue the Aladdin reference). Seizing this opportunity of a new world, they crafted a vessel known as the "Boum" and sailed into the Indian Ocean, establishing new trade routes bridging their newfound home with the rest of the world. Consequently, trade grew and made merchants of the former migrants and in effect created a new economy within this land. 

Little did they know that this would spark the transformation of their small coastal community into a global oil powerhouse known as Kuwait, all because of God’s will first and then a single vessel: Al-Boum. Today, Kuwait’s prosperity empowers its youth through education, sending students abroad to pursue knowledge... students like us. So, when presented with an opportunity to create a new programming language, it was only fitting to pay homage to the vessel that brought us here. So without further ado, we present Boum.


# Features
- Uses old Kuwaiti phrases and words instead of lame english words
- Print means break because, ironically, when a Boum sinks people would say it printed (in arabic, one word has multiple meanings)
- Concludes long JS commands with small words that are part of a Boum that serve the same purpose of their respective JS replacement.

# Examples

| JavaScript  | Boum |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `break`  | `print`  |
| `let x = 10`  | `saw x = 10`  |
| `console.log("Hala!")`  | `gool("Hala!")`  |
| `console.log(x + 10 > 5)`  | `Sij(x + 10 > 10)`  |
| ```js if (a > b) { console.log('a is bigger than b');  } | ```js etha(a akbar min b) gool("a akbar min b")
